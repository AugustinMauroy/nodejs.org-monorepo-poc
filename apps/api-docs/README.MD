# This is an test **do not** implement this in nodejs.org

## Conclusion

This test to build nodejs api allow me to say "nodejs api-docs must build or deploy from nodejs.org repository".

So my idea it's to build an package will be public and publish in npmjs.com. It's will include an cli to `build` or `dev`. The source code will be in nodejs.org repository. And the package will use in nodejs/node repo.

## More inforamation about this package idea

Dependecies:
* nextjs
* nodejs ui-components
* nodejs i18n data
